> **Selling internationally? You're likely leaving millions in tariff recovery on the table.** At Manifest in Las Vegas this February, [Trade Duty Refund](https://tradedutyrefund.com?utm_source=Blog&utm_medium=manifest2026Vegas&utm_campaign=20260127) will show you exactly how much your business can save through expert duty drawback and duty reclaim solutions across the US, UK, and EU markets.

## The Cost of Missing Out on Duty Refunds

For e-commerce retailers and end-to-end logistics providers operating globally, tariffs represent one of the largest hidden costs in your supply chain. Yet most businesses don't have the expertise or infrastructure to recover the duties and taxes they're eligible to reclaim.

The reality? Legitimate duty refunds are available across every major market:

- **US duty drawback** on re-exported goods and materials
- **EU duty refund** schemes for cross-border transactions
- **UK duty repayments** that benefit to both UK brands importing and exporting 3rd party goods, and non UK brands that sell B2C.
- **Multi-jurisdictional savings** when coordinated strategically

Missing these opportunities means leaving millions in legitimate refunds unclaimed—money that could strengthen margins, fund growth, or invest in supply chain optimization.

## Why Most Retailers Aren't Capturing These Savings

Duty refund complexity stops most businesses cold. It requires:

- Deep regulatory knowledge across multiple jurisdictions
- Contractual engagement with specialists in various parts of the world
- Coordination with customs brokers, forwarders, and compliance teams
- Ongoing monitoring of changing trade policies

That's exactly why [Trade Duty Refund](https://tradedutyrefund.com?utm_source=Blog&utm_medium=manifest2026Vegas&utm_campaign=20260127) exists. Our team of seasoned cross-border trade experts, domiciled across multiple continents, handles the complexity so you don't have to.

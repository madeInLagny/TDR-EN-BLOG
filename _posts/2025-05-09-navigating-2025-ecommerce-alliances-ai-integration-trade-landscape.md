> In 2025, e-commerce sellers are uniting to navigate the complexities of increased tariffs, supply chain disruptions, and the evolving landscape of AI integration. As highlighted in this recent **Forbes** article, these challenges have prompted a collective response from the global e-commerce community.

The imposition of 145% tariffs on Chinese imports has significantly impacted small and medium-sized e-commerce businesses, leading to increased operational costs and logistical hurdles. In response, many sellers are forming alliances to share resources, strategies, and insights to mitigate these challenges.

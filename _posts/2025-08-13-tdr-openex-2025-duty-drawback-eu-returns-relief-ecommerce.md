## Why TDR’s Services Matter to E-Commerce Leaders

[**TDR (Trade Duty Refund)**](https://tradedutyrefund.com?utm_source=LinkedIn&utm_medium=Post&utm_campaign=20250813Article) was front and center at OPENeX 2025, serving as a vital resource for B2C and B2B cross-border retail brands, vendors, and logistics managers facing mounting regulatory complexity and margin compression across the UK, EU, and US. TDR’s offering is uniquely crafted to meet the shifting needs of high-volume, multi-market supply chains.

### Duty Drawback: Recovering Margins in Cross-Border E-Commerce

For e-commerce retailers exporting from the UK or EU, this means reclaiming up to 100% of duties for eligible products. TDR automates the paperwork, reconciles trade data, and ensures compliance at scale. The result: boosted margins, improved cash flow, and enhanced inventory agility for e-commerce operators managing frequent returns or global stock movements.

  - Brands using European distribution hubs for global fulfillment.
  - Importers re-exporting unsold stock or supplying EU / US-based marketplaces.

- **Benefits:**
  - Recover up to 100% of duties on eligible goods.
  - Reduce cost of returns and unsold stock.
  - Enhance end-to-end supply chain visibility.

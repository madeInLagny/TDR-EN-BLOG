## OPENeX 2025 — Where Innovation Meets Cross-Border Trade

Hosted at Liège Airport and presented by NeX eCommerce in partnership with the ACE Air Cargo Event and LGG e‑Com Day, **OPENeX 2025** unites over 500 senior decision makers from across the e-commerce, logistics, and freight industries. Its “one ticket, three events” format offers a dynamic platform to explore the future of global e-commerce logistics and compliance.

This year’s program is set to deliver:
- **Masterclasses** from industry leaders.
- **High-impact networking** opportunities.
- **Exclusive 1:1 meetings** for direct collaboration.
- **Real-world case studies** on overcoming supply chain and regulatory challenges.

For businesses engaged in cross-border trade, OPENeX 2025 is not just an event — it’s a strategic opportunity to align with innovators, regulators, and industry disruptors.

## Why TDR’s Solutions Matter — Especially Now

For e-commerce businesses, regulatory complexity and changing trade rules across the UK, EU, and US can be costly and time-consuming. From post-Brexit customs barriers to the increasing cost of returns and customer expectations for smooth cross-border shopping experiences, decision makers need both **strategic advisory** and **hands-on operational solutions**.

TDR (Trade Duty Reclaim) has built its service portfolio to address exactly these challenges. At OPENeX 2025, we’ll be focusing on four key solutions that deliver measurable value — whether you’re a small DTC merchant or a multinational e-commerce platform.

### Duty Drawback — Recover Margins from Cross-Border Flows

**The challenge:** When goods are imported and then later exported, returned, or destroyed, businesses often lose money on unrecovered tariffs and customs duties.

**Our solution:** [TDR’s Duty drawback service](https://blog.tradedutyrefund.com/duty-drawback-us-importers-guide-tariffs-refunds-e-commerce-retail/?utm_source=LinkedIn&utm_medium=Post&utm_campaign=20250813Article) automates reclaiming these costs — recovering up to 100% of duties for eligible products. This is ideal for brands operating out of centralized European hubs or managing multiple return points across markets.

- **Use cases:**
  - Fashion & electronics merchants managing high volumes of returns.
  - Retailers with European distribution hubs fulfilling international orders.
  - Importers exporting unsold stock or replenishing other markets.

- **Benefits:**
  - Recover significant capital tied up in duties.
  - Improve cash flow and operational flexibility.
  - Seamlessly integrate into supply chain management systems.

### Returns Goods Relief (RGR) — Duty-Free Returns Made Simple

**The challenge:** E-commerce return rates often exceed 20% — and for cross-border sales, return logistics can inflate costs and erode customer satisfaction. Post-Brexit trade has made this even more complex.

**Our solution:** [TDR’s RGR](https://blog.tradedutyrefund.com/ask-the-experts-rgr-with-elke-rodel-what-is-returned-goods-relief-and-who-can-benefit/?utm_source=LinkedIn&utm_medium=Post&utm_campaign=20250813Article)  service ensures goods returning to their original market avoid unnecessary re-import duties and VAT. This means a smoother customer experience and substantial operational savings.

- **Use cases:**
  - Fashion merchants with high cross-border return rates.
  - UK/EU brands managing post-Brexit reverse logistics.
  - Inventory planning teams looking to restock or dispose of returned goods efficiently.

- **Benefits:**
  - Avoid paying duties twice on the same goods.
  - Increase reverse supply chain speed and efficiency.
  - Boost customer trust with hassle-free returns.

### Trade Advisory — Navigating a Complex Regulatory World

**The challenge:** Entering and operating in multiple jurisdictions exposes businesses to a constantly changing compliance environment that can lead to delays, penalties, and lost opportunities.

**Our solution:** TDR’s advisory services provide expert guidance on:
- Rules of origin and customs valuation.
- Brexit-related trade changes.
- VAT optimization for different sales channels.
- Risk mapping and simplified customs procedures.

Our consultants work alongside your team to ensure compliance, plan market entry, and mitigate risks before they impact your operations.

### EU Duty Reclaim — Unlocking Refund Opportunities

**The challenge:** Many companies trading across the EU miss out on reclaiming duties simply because the processes are complex and fragmented across member states.

**Our solution:** TDR specializes in accessing refund schemes, handling export refunds, and managing all necessary customs documentation — ensuring businesses recover every euro they are entitled to.

## What to Expect from TDR at OPENeX 2025

We will be sharing **case examples** (with anonymized data) showing how clients have saved millions in recovered duties and avoided unnecessary costs.  

We will also offer **exclusive 1:1 advisory sessions**, where our experts will discuss your company’s unique supply chain challenges and outline strategies to unlock cost recovery opportunities and accelerate compliance readiness.

## Why This Matters for Supply Chain Decision Makers

In 2025, global supply chain realities are shaped by:
- Ongoing regulatory change in major markets.
- Rising transportation and customs costs.
- Increased customer expectation for affordable, frictionless cross-border shopping.

These trends make **cost recovery and compliance agility** essential to competitiveness.

By working with TDR, decision makers can:
- **Lower landed costs** with automated recovery and RGR capabilities.
- **Expand into new markets faster** with expert compliance insights.
- **Protect margins** against global cost pressures.
- **Deliver better customer experiences** through smoother logistics and returns.

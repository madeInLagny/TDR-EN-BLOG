## Why Duty Refund Matters

Duty refunds and drawbacks are often overlooked possibilities for importers and exporters. These refund opportunities enable businesses to recover duties, VAT, and other charges paid on goods that are either re-exported, unused, returned, or incorrectly classified. For companies trading internationally, this refund mechanism can represent substantial savings and improved cashflow. By leveraging the Duty Refund Assessment, businesses can streamline the process and maximize recovery without getting bogged down in bureaucracy.

## The TDR Duty Refund Self-Assessment: A Smarter Way to Claim

Recognizing the need for a straightforward process, TDR has developed region-specific questionnaires tailored for the US, EU, and UK. These assessments provide instant feedback on refund potential and guide companies toward expert recommendations. The platform offers AI-driven insights based on shipment patterns, import/export history, and return handling, ensuring that businesses receive regionally relevant advice and support for multi-country operations. Whether a company is involved in e-commerce, B2C, traditional retail, or logistics, TDR’s solution adapts to diverse trading models to maximize cashback from overpaid duties.

## How the Self-Assessment Works

Using the TDR self-assessment is simple. The process begins with a short questionnaire asking for essential details like total duties paid over specific periods, the types of goods imported or exported, handling of returned inventory, sales channels, and the countries where import/export clearance occurs. Businesses are also prompted to specify their use of express carriers or consolidation warehouses and confirm their status as importer/exporter of record. This systematic approach makes it easy for professionals and newcomers alike to gauge eligibility and healing realistic projections of how much they could reclaim.

Upon completion, an expert team uses automation and data analysis to provide prompt feedback on eligibility, with tailored estimates of potential duty refunds.

## US Duty Drawback Questionnaire

For companies trading in and out of the United States, the US Import Duty Refund Questionnaire focuses on customs duty mitigation schemes specific to the US context. Information such as duties paid, export and return percentages, and the role of express shipments and consolidation in the supply chain is collected. The questionnaire also identifies the status of the business as an importer/exporter of record and any partnerships involved. With these details, the system can rapidly estimate drawback recovery potential, which can reach up to 99% of eligible duties in some cases. Powerful AI models and process automation help reduce friction and accelerate claim cycles for all types of importers, including e-commerce operators handling high volumes of returns.

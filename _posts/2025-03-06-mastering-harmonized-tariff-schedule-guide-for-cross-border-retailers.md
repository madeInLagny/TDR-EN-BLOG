> With global trade consistently growing but facing increased uncertainty, businesses, especially cross-border retailers, must be more strategic and agile than ever. One crucial, but often overlooked, factor is the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS).

HTS is the system that assigns codes to imported goods, determining duty rates, trade restrictions, and compliance requirements. This system is essential for international trade efficiency and can significantly impact e-commerce trends and cross-border trade.

With recent global trade shakeups and the Trump Administration's imposition of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, along with an additional 10% on China, now is the time for businesses to audit their HTS codes and optimize compliance to avoid costly surprises. This is particularly important for global retailers looking to manage customs costs and ensure smooth customs operations.

> The "de minimis" tax exemption is a hot topic globally, especially with the surge in cross-border e-commerce. Under these rules, low-value goods are exempt from customs duties, significantly impacting international trade and duty refunds.

The United States has one of the highest de minimis thresholds, set at $800 USD. In 2024, the U.S. processed a staggering 1.36 billion de minimis shipments, averaging around 3.8 million packages daily. This equates to an estimated $61 billion to $78 billion USD in goods crossing the border tax-free.

However, changes are on the horizon. The U.S. is considering eliminating de minimis exemptions for China, the world's largest e-commerce market. Similarly, regions like the EU and UK are reevaluating their de minimis policies.

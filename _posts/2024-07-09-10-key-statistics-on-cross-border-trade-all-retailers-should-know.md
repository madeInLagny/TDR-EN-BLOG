## 9. Returns can be an unpredictable market:

On average, ecommerce sales see an 18.1% return rate, while physical stores experience returns of only 8-10%. Interestingly, the return rate for expensive products is even higher than average, at a whopping 50%. And during the holiday seasons, rates can reach as high as 30%. January is the most popular month for returns.

## 10. Fraudulent Claims:

With the rate of returns growing, so are the attempts at fraud. Last year, 11% of returns were fraudulent with returns representing a $212 billion USD market. Those false claims add up for retailers.

Companies - both retailers and e-Commerce platforms - can’t ignore the growing presence of e-Commerce driven by digital culture and social media influencers. More and more consumers are shopping online, but this is also changing their buying habits and also increasing the demand for returned items.

Here is a quick checklist for global retailers facing the heat of returns:
Are you seeing your rate of returns increase?
What does it cost you per returned item to process the request?
Do you fully understand the customs regulations and compliance issues?
Are you paying customs duties to import and export items during returns?

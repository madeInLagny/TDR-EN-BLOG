## What Is U.S. Duty Drawback?

**Duty Drawback** is a long-standing customs refund program administered by **U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)**. It allows importers and exporters to recover duties, taxes, and fees paid on imported merchandise that is subsequently exported or destroyed.  

Many companies are unaware that they qualify for these refunds â€” or assume the process is too complex. In reality, with the right documentation and guidance, the savings can be significant. For some businesses, drawback refunds can represent **a 2â€“5% improvement in gross margins**.

### Why Duty Drawback Matters

- **Boosts cash flow:** Instead of losing paid import duties, you recover nearly all of them.  
- **Improves competitiveness:** Lower landed costs mean better pricing flexibility.  
- **Reduces waste:** Products that canâ€™t be sold domestically can still generate value when exported or destroyed.  
- **Supports sustainability goals:** Reuse, resale, or destruction of defective goods under Customs supervision ensures compliance and efficiency.

## The Three Main Types of Duty Drawback

The U.S. Duty Drawback program is divided into three main categories. Understanding which one fits your operations is key to maximizing refunds.

### 1. Unused Merchandise Drawback

This applies when imported goods are **exported in essentially the same condition** as when imported. Itâ€™s especially relevant to **eCommerce companies handling returns** or reselling unsold stock overseas.

**Example:**  
A fashion retailer imports sneakers into the U.S. for online sales. Customers return some items, and the retailer exports them to the EU warehouse. Under unused merchandise drawback, the retailer can claim back 99% of the import duties on those pairs.

### 2. Rejected Merchandise Drawback

This provision applies to goods that:  
- Donâ€™t meet specifications,  
- Were shipped without the buyerâ€™s consent, or  
- Were defective upon arrival or after sale.  

As long as the products are exported or destroyed under Customs supervision, you can claim duties back.

**Example:**  
A shoe manufacturer imports 1,000 pairs but discovers 200 are defective. Those 200 pairs are exported to the supplier or destroyed under supervision. The importer qualifies for drawback on those 200 pairs.

### 3. Manufacturing Drawback

Manufacturing drawback applies when imported materials or components are **used to produce a new article for export**. The finished good must have a new name, character, or use compared to the imported parts.

**Example:**  
A U.S. electronics firm imports microchips to build circuit boards that are then exported. The company may reclaim duties on the imported chips under the manufacturing drawback provision.

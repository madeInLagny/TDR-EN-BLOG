## Duty Drawback Refund: How Much Can Be Reclaimed?

Eligible businesses can reclaim up to **99%** of customs duties, Merchandise Processing Fees (MPF), and Harbor Maintenance Fees (HMF) paid on qualifying imported goods.

### Typical Refund Calculation

The standard formula for refund calculation is:

$$
\text{Duty Drawback Refund} = \text{Import Duties Paid} \times \text{Percentage of Goods Exported} \times 99\%
$$

#### Example:

Suppose a business imports \$500,000 worth of goods, and exports 30% of them. The potential refund is:

$$
\$500,000 \times 30\% \times 99\% = \$148,500
$$

This refund can be substantial, notably impacting financial performance and enabling reinvestment in growth strategies.

## Duty Drawback Process: Step-by-Step Guidance

Navigating the duty drawback process efficiently requires attention to detail and strict regulatory compliance. Below is a step-by-step overview to help businesses prepare and succeed.

### 1. Review Import and Export Activity

Start by identifying products that qualify for duty drawback—those imported and either exported, used in exported manufacturing, or destroyed. Collect documentation such as import entry summaries, bills of lading, and manufacturing records.

### 2. Determine Claim Type

There are three main types of duty drawback claims:

- **Unused Merchandise Drawback**: For exported items that were never used domestically.
- **Manufacturing Drawback**: For exported goods manufactured wholly or partially from imported materials.
- **Rejected Merchandise Drawback**: For returned, damaged, or non-conforming imports.

Determining the correct claim type early is crucial for compliance and maximizing refund potential.

### 3. Collect Documentation

Prepare supporting paperwork, including:

- Import and export documentation
- Proof of manufacturing or destruction
- Evidence of commercial interchangeability, if claiming substitution drawback

Robust documentation is the backbone of any successful drawback claim and helps mitigate audit risks.

### 4. File Your Claim

Submit the duty drawback claim to the relevant customs authority. In the US, claims are filed through Customs and Border Protection (CBP). In the UK and Europe, claims go through the respective national agencies. Claims usually must be made within five years of the export event.

### 5. Claim Approval and Refund

Customs authorities review and verify all submitted information. Upon approval, they issue the refund—often up to 99% of qualifying duties—usually within 30–90 days. Businesses with Accelerated Payment Privilege may receive their refunds much faster.

> After more than 25 years in the world of customs consulting working with importers, exporters, logistics teams, and trade compliance professionals across dozens of industries, I've learned one thing for certain: even as regulations evolve and technology changes, the core concerns of businesses stay surprisingly consistent.

Whether I'm consulting with a startup looking to expand globally or a multinational supply chain team refining their trade compliance strategy, there are certain questions that come up time and time again. I thought I'd share the top three questions I get, along with my answers, here for anyone navigating the complex world of cross-border trade.

## 1. "How do I know if my products are classified correctly?"

This is the holy grail of customs compliance—and also where most businesses get tripped up. Harmonized System (HS) classification is more than just picking a code that "looks close." It determines your duty rate, admissibility, eligibility for trade programs (like USMCA or GSP), and can even impact your risk profile with customs authorities. This is one of the first red flags customs authorities may see upon arrival and block your product.

### What I tell clients:

Always base classification on the product's essential character and objective criteria—not on marketing descriptions or internal naming conventions. And document your rationale. If customs comes calling and wants to perform an audit, you will want to show your work.

I've helped companies avoid penalties by documenting properly and save a significant amount in their bottom line by correcting misclassifications.

## 2. "What can we do to lower our duties and taxes?"

Everyone's looking to save money, and duties often feel like an unavoidable cost. The good news: they're often more manageable than people think.

### My advice:

Start by exploring available trade agreements (USMCA, EU FTAs, etc.), duty drawback programs, and tariff engineering opportunities. In some cases, minor product modifications or changes in sourcing can yield significant savings.

Also, many companies overlook the power of origin planning. Where and how a product is made can drastically affect your duty exposure.

Lastly, companies are often eligible for duty drawback programs or can avoid duties altogether based on the value of their products and the final destination of the products. In some cases, companies claim back up to 100% of duties paid. Through just a quick consultation, I've helped companies calculate how much they could be claiming back and how to get that process started.

## 3. "What happens if we get audited?"

This one usually comes with a hint of panic, and rightly so. Customs audits are serious business, and there are usually a few things that set off customs authorities. The big three red flags are: incomplete or inaccurate documentation, restricted or prohibited items, and unclear or misleading product descriptions.

### My response:

Be proactive, not reactive. Implement an internal compliance program before Customs comes knocking. That means regular classification reviews, valuation checks, origin documentation, and broker management procedures.

If you do get audited, transparency and organization are your best defense. Customs isn't expecting perfection—they're expecting diligence.

Let the experts handle your customs procedures and documentation!

## Final Thoughts

Customs compliance can be a competitive advantage for companies today. Companies that take it seriously ship faster, save more, and rest easy.

After 25 years in this field, I've come to see customs not as a bureaucratic hurdle, but as a critical part of doing global business the right way.

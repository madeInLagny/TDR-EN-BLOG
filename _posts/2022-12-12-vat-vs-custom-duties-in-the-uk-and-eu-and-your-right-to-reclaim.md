Doing business internationally in today’s economy is almost a given for many merchants. Digital platforms and faster and smarter logistics have made it easier to create global demand for products and, consequently, be able to fulfill and ship orders across borders. International eCommerce has already exploded and is only set to steadily grow in the coming years. The United Kingdom and European Union single market are among the top players in international trade. 

While international trade provides significant advantages for many retailers, it comes with a plethora of fiscal responsibilities that can leave any import or export manager overwhelmed, if not at times, dubious. 

Every country sets their tax and duty regulations when it comes to international trade. While most merchants generally lump these obligations under “financial burdens”, it is important to know the differences and most importantly, where companies can claim money back.

Let’s start with some simple definitions that merchants are already familiar with:

### VAT (Value-Added Tax): this is a consumption tax applied to goods and services in European Union and non-EU countries like the UK. 

Each country can set their VAT rate for goods and services and discounted rates for certain categories. For example, in Italy, the standard VAT is 22%, but there are discounted rates at 10% and 5% for certain necessities like food. 

The European Commission governs a VAT Directive and the law dictates that VAT must be at least 15% [^2], but otherwise leaves the rate to the discretion of each country. 

This VAT system is for goods and services consumed within the EU, and therefore, “goods which are sold for export or services which are sold to customers abroad are normally not subject to VAT. Conversely imports are taxed to keep the system fair for EU producers so that they can compete on equal terms on the European market with suppliers situated outside the Union”. 

The UK, now outside the EU, has a standard VAT of 20%, and just like EU laws, the UK does not apply its standard VAT outside the UK, but applies the 20% rate to imported goods to the UK.

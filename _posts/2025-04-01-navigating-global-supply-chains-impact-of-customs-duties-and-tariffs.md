> Global supply chains face significant challenges due to customs duties and tariffs, prompting companies to reevaluate their sourcing strategies. Elevated tariffs on imported goods increase production costs, forcing businesses to decide how to manage these expenses effectively.

Global companies are adapting their strategies to maintain efficiency and competitiveness in a fluctuating market.

### Increased Costs and Pricing Adjustments

Tariffs elevate the cost of imported goods, leading businesses to either absorb these costs or pass them on to customers. For example, the U.S. has imposed a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum and an additional 20% tariff on Chinese goods. Economists predict these tariffs could push inflation up to 3%.

### Supply Chain Diversification

To mitigate tariffs, companies often seek to diversify by sourcing from multiple countries or relocating production closer to key markets. This strategy helps in managing costs and maintaining operational flexibility.

### Optimizing Duty Drawback

For cross-border retailers, understanding how to calculate duty drawback is crucial. Duty drawback allows businesses to reclaim duties paid on imported goods that are subsequently exported. This process can significantly reduce customs costs and improve overall profitability.

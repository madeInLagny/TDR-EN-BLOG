> There is a global shift toward digital customs declarations defined by speed, automation, and stricter compliance standards. But while digitalization brings immense benefits, it also introduces complexity, especially for businesses lacking in-house expertise. For companies navigating this new landscape, working with dedicated customs brokers and consultants is no longer optional—it’s a competitive advantage.

## The Digital Evolution of Customs

Customs authorities worldwide are modernizing their systems to process declarations electronically. Initiatives like the EU’s Union Customs Code (UCC), the UK’s CDS (Customs Declaration Service), and the U.S. Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) are driving this transformation. The goals are:

- Improve transparency
- Reduce fraud
- Accelerate processing
- Create more resilient supply chains

In theory, digital declarations make trade smoother and faster. But in practice, they demand accurate data, precise HS code classification, and real-time compliance with evolving rules. The margin for error is shrinking—and penalties for missteps are growing.

### What companies risk if not compliant

Mistakes in digital customs declarations can lead to:

- Delayed shipments and missed delivery windows
- Incorrect duties and taxes (either overpaid or underpaid)
- Customs audits, fines, and even reputational damage

For example, misclassifying goods with the wrong Harmonized System (HS) code could result in a 20% duty difference—or worse, legal non-compliance if the product is subject to restrictions or quotas.

The digital shift also means that customs systems are more integrated and traceable. Once an error is logged, it’s easier for authorities to spot patterns across multiple shipments or regions.

## Digital Declarations are Great, but Experts Make Them Run Smoother

### Consulting on Technology and Process Efficiency

Brokers can consult on which technology platforms and AI-driven technology can help your business with cross-border logistics and which systems can integrate with other business platforms. This enables smoother digital declaration submissions, document management, and status tracking.

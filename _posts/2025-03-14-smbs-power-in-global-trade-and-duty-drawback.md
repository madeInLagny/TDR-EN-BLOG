> Small to Mid-Size Businesses (SMBs) are a powerful force in most economies, especially in the U.S. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, SMBs with 500 employees or fewer make up 99.9% of all businesses. These businesses play a significant role in global trade, and many are eligible for customs duty drawbackâ€”a program that can significantly boost their financial performance.

The vast majority of SMBs engage in global exports, making them prime candidates for customs duty drawback. This program allows businesses to reclaim duties paid on imported goods that are subsequently exported, providing a substantial financial benefit.

For instance, a company that pays $5 million in duties annually and exports 25% of its goods could potentially recoup approximately $1.2 million through duty drawback claims. This highlights the importance of understanding and leveraging duty drawback for cross-border retailers and e-commerce experts.

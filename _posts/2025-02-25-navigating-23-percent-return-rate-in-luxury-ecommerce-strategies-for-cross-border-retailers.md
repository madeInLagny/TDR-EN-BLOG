> The luxury e-commerce sector faces a significant challenge with an average global return rate of 23%, amounting to approximately $38 billion USD in returned merchandise annually. As e-commerce continues to expand, consumers are increasingly purchasing high-end luxury items, often resulting in practices like "wardrobing" or "buyer's remorse" due to the substantial price tags.

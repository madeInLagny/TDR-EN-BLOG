### Key Factors in Duty Drawback Calculations

Several critical elements influence how much you can claim under duty drawback programs:

1. **Original Duty Paid**  
   Start by verifying the customs duties initially paid. If any adjustments or corrections apply, ensure they are factored into your claim.

2. **HS Code Classification**  
   The accuracy of your tariff classification is essential. Mistakes in HS codes can lead to reduced refunds or even rejections.

3. **Currency Rates**  
   Refund amounts must be converted using the exchange rate at the time of the original duty payment to ensure accurate reimbursement.

4. **Deductions**  
   Consider fees like non-refundable taxes, which may reduce the total amount refunded.

5. **Customs Valuation**  
   The declared value of goods must align with customs requirements to avoid complications in your claims.

6. **Program Percentage**  
   Different regions refund varying percentages of duties paid. Letâ€™s explore how this works in the EU, UK, and US.

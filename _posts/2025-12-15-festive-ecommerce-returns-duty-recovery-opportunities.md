> The post-holiday returns surge in e-commerce represents the peak season for refunds, offering savvy retailers a prime chance to reclaim import duties paid on those very goods. With return rates climbing as high as 30% during festive periods, this influx turns potential losses into recoverable cash flow through duty drawback programs. TDR stands ready to guide retailers and logistics providers in the EU, UK, and US to capitalize on this opportunity, starting with a simple chat or questionnaire.

## Holiday Returns Peak

The festive season drives record e-commerce sales, but it also unleashes the highest volume of returns. Industry data shows return rates averaging 16-18% year-round, spiking to 30% or more post-holidays, with millions of packages flooding back in early January alone. In the US, holiday sales are projected to exceed $1 trillion in 2025, yet shoppers return billions in purchases, straining logistics while creating duty recovery potential.

This surge stems from gift mismatches, sizing issues, and buyer's remorse amplified by aggressive promotions. UK and EU retailers face similar pressures amid Brexit complexities and tightening tariffs, where returned goods often incur double duties without proper handling. Forward-thinking businesses view this not as a burden, but as a financial lifeline through reclaim mechanisms.
